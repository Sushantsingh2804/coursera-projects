              <h4>Siberian Husky</h4>
          </div>

          <p>The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes
             one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed,
             Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait.

              <h4>Labrador Retriever</h4>
          </div>

          <p>The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as fishermen’s helpers:
            hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.

              <h4>GermanShepherd</h4>
          </div>

          <p>German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of
            smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or
            two and reach great speeds.</p>
